# C++ Coding Exercises

My completed exercises from the book C++ Crash Course by Josh Lospinso and from my academic training.

### Exercise 1 - Absolute Value / Sum
Finds the absolute value of a number and the sum of two numbers.

### Exercise 2 - Calculator Operation
Creates a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide. Uses an enum class, constructors and methods.

### Exercise 3 - Array Manipulation
Creates two char arrays and both a read and write function that can both read/print the arrays and write to them. The function also checks for buffer overflows and will not execute if a call is made outside the array.
